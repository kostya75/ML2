###Objective: use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and predict the correct the class of how they performed the exercise


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
